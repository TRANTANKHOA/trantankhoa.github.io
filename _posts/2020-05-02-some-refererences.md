title: Are you new to Scala?

# Some good resource for newcomers to Scala
* I think the best way to learn how to use Scala right and quick is to read directly from the creator of the language himself e.g. with [Scala by example](https://www.scala-lang.org/old/sites/default/files/linuxsoft_archives/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf) or [Programming in Scala](https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_4ed)
* If you're looking for a practical productivity boost from Scala as a new object oriented language, I would recommend reading e.g. [Alvin Alexander](http://alvinalexander.com/scala/differences-scalaz-task-scala-future-referential-lazy/) or just the [Scala tour](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html)
* If you're coming from a pure functional background e.g. [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), then you would typically prefer reading about the [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) library and people like [Rúnar Óli Bjarnason](http://blog.higher-order.com/assets/trampolines.pdf) or [Tim Perrett](https://timperrett.com/2014/07/20/scalaz-task-the-missing-documentation/). But please remember that you don't have to do or learn all the functional programming to gain productivity from using Scala. I'll talk about that more around here.
